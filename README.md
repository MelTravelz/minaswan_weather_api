# Planning & Pseudocode

- Planning to ONLY do happy path testing for now
- Pretending `Weather API` does NOT return temperature in C
    - therefore, we can convert F to C
- Assuming we are allowed to use OpenStruct

---

[x] Test `Weather API` endpoint with Postman
[x] Create local & remote repositories
[x] Setup repo with gems, secrets, PR template

[x] Service spec test
[x] Service 

[x] Ensure VCR/fixture files are working correctly

[x] Request spec test
[x] Controller & Route

[x] Facade spec test
[x] Facade
[x] possibly create PORO or use OpenStruct depending on need

[x] Serializer

[x] don't forget to lint all work

[x] Test localhost endpoint "/api/v1/weather?city_name="Istanbul" with Postman
